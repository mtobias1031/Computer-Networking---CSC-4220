This was an assignment to replicate how UDP Pinging Works.

In order to use this, please follow the following steps.

1. On a terminal or command, open the directory in which server.py and client.py are saved.

2. In the terminal, launch the server application. ex. “python server.py”

3. Open another terminal while the server.py application continues to run. The server.py application is acting as a local host, which will receive the pings from the client application.

4. In the additional terminal, run the client.py application. This will then ping the local host. Each run will be different then the one before, thus representing how UDP pinging works.
